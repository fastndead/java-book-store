# Java Book Store
 Java Book Store is a web application that allows users to browse and purchase books online. It is built using Java and Spring Boot, and provides an
interactive interface for managing books, orders, and customers.

   This project was built as a part of university assignment for Java, nothing serious.

## Getting Started
 To get started with Java Book Store, you can clone the repository and switch to the `master` branch. From there, you can build and run the application:
```
git clone https://github.com/fastndead/java-book-store.git
cd java-book-store
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
This will start the application and open it in your default browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
## Usage
 Once you have the application running, you can use the interface to manage books, orders, and customers. You can add new books, update existing books, and
delete books from the catalog. You can also view and manage customer orders, including adding new orders, updating existing orders, and canceling orders.
The application provides several features for managing the book store, including:
- Book catalog management
- Customer order management
- User authentication and authorization
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order tracking and status updates
